# Chronic Kidney Disease Study in UAE

## Installation
The repository for this project can be cloned on your device using the commands below:

`git init`

`git clone https://github.com/MSADS-505-Data-Science-for-Business/predicting_employee_attrition.git`

## Overview
This repository contains the Python code and analysis for a study on Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the UAE. The analysis includes data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predive modeling using machine learning.

## Data
The dataset used in this study is comprised of various factors contributing to CKD, including sex, medical measurements, and diagnostic results. The data has been anonymized to protect patient privacy.

## Requirements
To run the analysis, you will need R and the following Python packages:

`aequitas==1.0.0`  
`lifelines==0.28.0`  
`matplotlib==3.7.1`  
`numpy==1.25.2`  
`pandas==1.5.3`  
`scikit-learn==1.2.2`  
`seaborn==0.13.1`  
`tqdm==4.66.2`


## Installation
To install the required Python packages, run the following command in the terminal:

```
! pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis, open the `CKD_UAE_Full_Notebook.ipynb` file in an IDE of your chouce and run the cells sequentially.
